=head1 Required Methods for Applying Roles

=head2 -> open_file file => FILE

Must take a filename and assume a state reset. 

=head2 -> next_section 

Must return true if a section was discovered.
Must return false otherwise.
This method is called before getting data out. 

=head2 -> section_offset

Returns the offset as an Integer 

=head2 -> section_size

Returns the sections computed size ( if possible )
If you can't compute the size, please call $self->log->logcroak() 

=head2 -> section_name

Returns the sections name

=head2 -> can_compute_size

This retuns wether or not this code is capable of discerning section sizes on its own. 
return 1 if true, return undef otherwise. 

This will make us try guessing how big sections are by sorting them.
