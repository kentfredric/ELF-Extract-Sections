Revision history for ELF-Extract-Sections

0.02020308 2009-11-20 05:05:28 UTC
           Tweaked Authortests/Release tests bundling somewhat
            so they actually work.

           Added Perl Critic tests and satisfied criteria.

           Documenting the hell out of the Objdump default 
            scanner, partially to see how CPAN renders this 
            abuse. With a bit of luck, it will produce mean 
            as API breakdowns for me :)

          Fixed t/ by using Compile Tests.
            ( You can thank JAWNSY for bugging me about this )

          Moved To AutoVersion::Relative

          Dropped EUMM
