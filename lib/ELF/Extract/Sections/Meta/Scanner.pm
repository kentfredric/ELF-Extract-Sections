=head1 NAME

ELF::Extract::Sections::Meta::Scanner - Interface Contract for Scanners

=head1 VERSION

version 1.001005

=head1 Required Methods for Applying Roles

=head2 C<open_file>

  my $file = $scanner->open_file( file => FILE )

Must take a file name and assume a state reset.

=head2 C<next_section>

  my $boolean = $scanner->next_section

Must return true if a section was discovered.
Must return false otherwise.
This method is called before getting data out.

=head2 C<section_offset>

  my $offset = $scanner->section_offset;

Returns the offset as an Integer

=head2 C<section_size>

  my $size = $scanner->section_size;

Returns the sections computed size ( if possible )
If you can't compute the size, please call $self->log->logcroak()

=head2 C<section_name>

  my $name = $scanner->section_name;

Returns the sections name

=head2 C<can_compute_size>

  my $boolean = $scanner->can_compute_size;

This returns whether or not this code is capable of discerning section sizes on its own.
return 1 if true, return C<undef> otherwise.

This will make us try guessing how big sections are by sorting them.
