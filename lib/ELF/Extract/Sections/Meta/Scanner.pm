=head1 NAME

ELF::Extract::Sections::Meta::Scanner - Interface Contract for Scanners

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02071411

=head1 Required Methods for Applying Roles

=head2 -> open_file file => FILE

Must take a file name and assume a state reset.

=head2 -> next_section

Must return true if a section was discovered.
Must return false otherwise.
This method is called before getting data out.

=head2 -> section_offset

Returns the offset as an Integer

=head2 -> section_size

Returns the sections computed size ( if possible )
If you can't compute the size, please call $self->log->logcroak()

=head2 -> section_name

Returns the sections name

=head2 -> can_compute_size

This returns whether or not this code is capable of discerning section sizes on its own.
return 1 if true, return C<undef> otherwise.

This will make us try guessing how big sections are by sorting them.
